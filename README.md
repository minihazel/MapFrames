# MapFrames
A simple mod that allows you to set map-specific framerate caps. Works only for 3.8.0 and up.

## Features
- Toggle for enabling or disabling the mod.
- 30 - 240fps caps for all currently available maps on SPT-AKI.
- Each map's framerate cap is customizable.

## How do I install this?
1. Download [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) (most likely the top option: `64-bit Windows x64`)
2. Open `MapFrames.zip` with 7-Zip
3. Drag and drop the `BepInEx` folder straight into your SPT folder (where `Aki.Server.exe` is)
4. Done

## Project Setup
Copy all DLL files from the following SPT directories into `\Dependencies`:
- `\EscapeFromTarkov_Data\Managed\`
- `\BepInEx\plugins\spt\`
- `\BepInEx\core\`
